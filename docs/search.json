It suggests that the seminar takes place at lunch time, when audience is invited to bring their food and have lunch while listening to the speaker.\n\n\n2 Rules\n\nEach seminar lasts 1 hour and starts at noon.\nBring your lunch and consume it quietly, respecting the speaker.\nThe seminar is discussion focused: presenters should aim to give at least 20 minutes for discussion at the end, or even better, have a round of discussion every 3-4 slides.\nThe target audience are PhD students.
