    "text": "1 Information\n“Brown bag” is a series of seminars focused on agriculture, food, and economics in low and middle income settings.\n\n\n\nFarming in Mali (source).\n\n\nThe name originates from the paper bag children used to bring to school with lunch inside. It suggests that the seminar takes place at lunch time, when audience is invited to bring their food and have lunch while listening to the speaker.\n\n\n2 Rules\n\nEach seminar lasts 1 hour and starts at noon.\nBring your lunch and consume it quietly, respecting the speaker.\nThe seminar is discussion focused, we give enough time for questions, answers, and discussion on the topic. When you prepare a presentation, do not overload it with information or slides - leave room for everyone to ask questions and talk.\n\n\n\n3 Upcoming seminars\n\n2024 Sep 12\n2024 Oct 03\n2024 Nov 07\n2024 Dec 05\n\n\n\n4 Past seminars\n\n\n\n\n2024 Jul 04\nSOL B 4\nChristian Grovermann, FiBL\nEvidence for agroecological intensification (slides)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024 Jun 06\nSOL B 4\nPhilipa Birago Akuoko, University of Bern\nGoverning informality in public spaces and its implication for food supply (slides)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024 May 02\nSOL B 4\nCelestina Heepen, FSEP (ETHZ)\nQualitative investigation of labour matching processes in the Swiss vine production\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024 Apr 04\nCLD D 1\nRebecca Alcock, University of Wisconsin-Madison\nRural health facility electrification with off-grid solar and micromobility networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024 Mar 07\nSOL B 4\nMarie Sigrist, AET (ETHZ)\nI have no choice, I have to pick this coffee to cope!
