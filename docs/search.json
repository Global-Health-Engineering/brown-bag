    "text": "1 Information\n“Brown bag” is a series of seminars focused on agriculture, food, and economics in low and middle income settings.\nThe name originates from the paper bag children used to bring to school with lunch inside. It suggests that the seminar takes place at lunch time, when audience is invited to bring their food and have lunch while listening to the speaker.\n\n\n2 Rules\n\nEach seminar lasts 1 hour and starts at noon.\nBring your lunch and consume it quietly, respecting the speaker.\nThe seminar is discussion focused, we give enough time for questions, answers, and discussion on the topic. When you prepare a presentation, do not overload it with information or slides - leave room for everyone to ask questions and talk.\n\n\n\n3 Upcoming seminars\n\n2024 Sep 12\n2024 Oct 03\n2024 Nov 07\n2024 Dec 05\n\n\n\n4 Past seminars\n\n\n\nDate\nPresenter\nTitle\nAffiliation\nLocation\n\n\n\n\n2024 Jul 04\nChristian Grovermann\nEvaluations of agroforestry field schools in the Sahel (or) Research related to organic certification in Vietnam and Thailand\nFiBL\nSOL B 4\n\n\n2024 Jun 06\nPhilipa Birago Akuoko\nUrban informality, the public space and food supply\nUniversity of Bern\nSOL B 4\n\n\n2024 May 02\nCelestina\nQualitative investigation of labour matching processes in the Swiss vine production - Presentation storage - Goals or mission of the Brownbag\nFSEP\nSOL B 4\n\n\n2024 Apr 04\nRebecca Alcock\nTopic: Rural health facility electrification with off-grid solar and micromobility networks: a discussion about field work 5 mins feedback\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison\nCLD D 1\n\n\n2024 Mar 07\nMarie Sigrist\nI have no choice, I have to pick this coffee to cope!
