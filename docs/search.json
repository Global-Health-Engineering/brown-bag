It suggests that the seminar takes place at lunch time, when audience is invited to bring their food and have lunch while listening to the speaker.\n\n\n2 Rules\n\nEach seminar lasts 1 hour and starts at noon.\nBring your lunch and consume it quietly, respecting the speaker.\nThe seminar is discussion focused: presenters should aim to give at least 20 minutes for discussion at the end, or even better, have a round of discussion every 3-4 slides.\nThe target audience are PhD students. Professors and other senior staff should only ask questions after all PhD questions have been answered.\n\n\n\n3 Upcoming seminars\n\n\n\n\n2025 Oct 2\nSOL B 4\nPadraic Casserly, Global Health Engineering (GHE), ETHZ\nExploratory approaches to eliminate pathogens from a community sanitation system in Malawi\n\n\n\n4 Past seminars\n\n2025\n\n\n\n\n\n2025 Sep 18\nSOL B 4\nLukas Fesenfeld, Energy and Technology Policy Group (ETP), ETHZ\nThe Political Economy of Transforming Livestock Systems\n\n\n\n\n\n2025 Aug 7\nSOL B 4\nMarc Müller, Eawag and University of Notre Dame,\nDid irrigation expansion improve household nutrition?\n\n\n\n\n\n2025 Jul 10\nSOL B 4\nMichael Brander & Matthias Huss, Impaxio\nUsing SMS and WhatsApp surveys to collect data in academic research projects - Showcasing Impaxio\n\n\n\n\n\n2025 Jun 5\nSOL B 4\nSaloni Vijay, Global Health Engineering (GHE), ETHZ\nChallenges in Air Quality and Health Impact Monitoring from Open Waste Burning in Under-Monitored Regions\n\n\n\n\n\n2025 Apr 3\nSOL B 4\nMartina Occelli, Cornell University\nLocal Ecological Knowledge: A Space for Interdisciplinarity and Inclusivity in crop Improvement\n\n\n\n\n\n2025 Mar 6\nSOL B 4\nFatemeh Adelisardou, The Agroecological Transitions Group (AET), ETHZ\nImproving Sustainability of Food Production Under Climate Change: Reinventing Agroecological Rice Farming in Iran\n\n\n\n\n\n2025 Feb 6\nSOL B 4\nNicolas Pons-Vignon, University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI)\nBuilding Labour Power through Worker-driven Research?
